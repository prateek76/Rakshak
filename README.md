# (Rakshak) Smart pressure pads

## Abstract
In a crowd crush, people are subjected to compressive forces by being
pushed from all sides (or against a barrier such as a wall) with nowhere
to move into. In a progressive crowd collapse, one person falls, creating
a space in the crowd into which others fall, creating an even larger hole.
This innovation will try to solve such problems.

## Introduction
Crowd management experts say human stampedes often begin when
people in front of a group reach a barrier of some form and stop
moving or slow down their pace, while those behinds (and who can not
see in front) keep moving, assuming those in front will make space.
They could perhaps be more accurately described as a "crowd crush",
where most deaths are from compressive asphyxiation rather than
trampling.
"The accident, as most know, was a stampede caused by overcrowding
and also caused by some of the pilgrims not following the movement
instructions of the security and the Hajj ministry," Saudi Arabia's health
minister Khalid al-Falih said after the Hajj tragedy.
In the case of the recent Hajj stampede, a type of barrier was formed by
a collision between two groups moving towards each other on the
same road, according to BBC reports.
Deadly stampedes usually start with a few people killed by the sheer
force of the tightly-packed group at the collision point.
Enough force can be produced by a crowd to crush people where they
stand.
This can cause rumors to spread around the crowd that people have
been crushed, leading to mass panic and people speeding up their
walking speed, crowd safety expert Professor G Keith Still told the
Washington Post.
"Once that starts, it's already too late to stop the incident escalating,"
Professor Still said.
Crowds then push horizontally and stack on top of each other vertically
in a desperate bid to escape, with many fatally crushed.
Deadly stampedes are not always caused by crowd panic, though â€”
they can also be caused by entrapment in a limited area and physical
strain.
As well as at religious pilgrimages, stampedes have caused deaths at
sporting matches, music events and during emergency situations, such
as fires and explosions.
