                Crowd management experts say human stampedes often begin when people in front of a group reach a barrier of some form and stop moving or slow down their pace, while those behind (and who cannot see in front) keep moving, assuming those in front will make space.

They could perhaps be more accurately described as a "crowd crush", where most deaths are from compressive asphyxiation rather than trampling.

"The accident, as most know, was a stampede caused by overcrowding and also caused by some of the pilgrims not following the movement instructions of the security and the Hajj ministry," Saudi Arabia's health minister Khalid al-Falih said after the Hajj tragedy.

In the case of the recent Hajj stampede, a type of barrier was formed by a collision between two groups moving towards each other on the same road, according to BBC reports.

Deadly stampedes usually start with a few people killed by the sheer force of the tightly-packed group at the collision point.

Enough force can be produced by a crowd to crush people where they stand.

This can cause rumors to spread around the crowd that people have been crushed, leading to mass panic and people speeding up their walking speed, crowd safety expert Professor G Keith Still told the Washington Post.

"Once that starts, it's already too late to stop the incident escalating," Professor Still said.

Crowds then push horizontally and stack on top of each other vertically in a desperate bid to escape, with many fatally crushed.

Deadly stampedes are not always caused by crowd panic, though â€” they can also be caused by entrapment in a limited area and physical strain.

As well as at religious pilgrimages, stampedes have caused deaths at sporting matches, music events and during emergency situations, such as fires and explosions.
